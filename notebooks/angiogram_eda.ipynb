        "This notebook demonstrates dataset inspection, preprocessing, and qualitative visualisation steps for the coronary artery segmentation project.\n",

        "## Suggested Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Environment setup**\n",
        "   - Activate the project virtual environment and ensure dependencies from `requirements.txt` are installed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Load dataset pairs**\n",
        "   - Use functions from `src.preprocessing` to enumerate image/mask paths.\n",
        "   - Compute dataset statistics with `describe_dataset`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Visual checks**\n",
        "   - Sample a handful of angiograms and overlay their masks using `visualize_samples`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Augmentation sanity checks**\n",
        "   - Apply `default_augmentation_pipeline` from `src.data.dataset` to view transformed samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Model-ready tensors**\n",
        "   - Instantiate `AngiogramSegmentationDataset` and inspect tensor shapes/values to verify normalisation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use this notebook as an entry point for additional experiments, such as building custom augmentations or integrating the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for zero-shot trials.\n",
